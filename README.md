# CE1_Nico_Bernhard_Josia
This is the CE 1 from Nico, Bernhard, Josia
We sat together in the same room and worked on the project together.

Our Project: Using the forbes_richman dataset available for free on kaggle, we want to explore the data and find out if the worth of the richest people in the world correlates with their age. 

The folder structure is as follows:

- scripts: Contains the script to run the analysis
- output: Contains the output of the analysis and the plots
- data_orig: Contains the original data (the used csv file is not uploaded due to gitignore)
- data_processed: Contains the processed data
